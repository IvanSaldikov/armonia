        </p>
        <h3>What Information this Privacy Policy Covers</h3>
        <p>This Privacy Policy covers information we collect from you through our Site. Some of our Site’s functionality
            can
            be used without revealing any Personal Data, but for features or Services related to the Content Offerings,
            Personal Data is required. In order to access certain features and benefits on our Site, you may need to submit,
            or we may collect,
            <b>"Personal Data"</b> (i.e., information that can be used to identify you and which may also
            be
            referred to as “personally identifiable information” or “personal information”). Personal Data can include
            information such as your name, email address, IP address, and device identifier, among other things. You are
            responsible for ensuring the accuracy of the Personal Data you submit to armonia.day. Inaccurate information
            may
            affect your ability to use the Site, the information you receive when using the Site, and our ability to contact
            you. For example, your email address should be kept current because that is one of the primary manners in which
            we
            communicate with you.</p>
        <h3>What You Agree to by Using Our Site</h3>
        <p>We consider that the legal bases for using your personal information as set out in this Privacy Policy are as
            follows:</p>
        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
            <li>our use of your personal information is necessary to perform our obligations under any contract with you
                (for
                example, to comply with the Terms of Service of our Site which you accept by browsing our website and/or to
                comply
                with our contract to provide Services to you, your academic institution, your employer, or other organization
                that
                may be providing you with access to our Services); or
            </li>
            <li>our use of your personal information is necessary for complying with our legal obligations; or</li>
            <li>use of your personal information is necessary for our legitimate interests or the legitimate interests of
                others. Our legitimate interests are to:
                <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                    <li> run, grow and develop our business;
                    </li>
                    <li> operate our Site and provide our Services;
                    </li>
                    <li> select appropriately skilled and qualified suppliers;
                    </li>
                    <li> build relationships with partners and academic institutions;
                    </li>
                    <li> carry out research and statistical analysis;
                    </li>
                    <li> carry out marketing and business development; and
                    </li>
                    <li> for internal administrative and auditing purposes.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li> consent, to send you certain communications or where you submit certain information to us, or where
                required to
                rely upon consent by local law.
            </li>
        </ul>


        <p>Which legal basis applies to a specific activity will depend on the type of personal information used and the
            context in which it is being used.</p>
        <p> If we rely on our (or another party’s) legitimate interests in using your personal information, we will
            undertake
            a balancing test to ensure that our (or the other party’s) legitimate interests are not outweighed by your
            interests or fundamental rights and freedoms which require protection of the personal information.
            We may process your personal information in some cases for marketing purposes on the basis of your consent
            (which
            you may withdraw at any time as described below).</p>
        <p>If we rely on your consent for us to use your personal information in a particular way, but you later change
            your
            mind, you may withdraw your consent by visiting your profile page and clicking the box to remove consent and we
            will stop doing so. If you withdraw your consent, this may impact the ability for us to provide some of our
            Services to you.</p>

            Policy, or unless such disclosure is necessary in special cases, such as a physical threat to you or others, as
            permitted by applicable law. Because the Internet is not a 100% secure environment, we cannot guarantee the
            security of Personal Data, and there is some risk that an unauthorized third party may find a way to circumvent
            our security systems or that transmission of your information over the Internet will be intercepted. It is your
            responsibility to protect the security of your login information. Please note that e-mail communications are
            typically not encrypted and should not be considered secure.</p>
        <h3>Updating or Deleting Your Personal Data</h3>
        <p> You have certain rights in relation to your Personal Data. You can access your Personal Data and confirm that
            it
            remains correct and up-to-date, choose whether you wish to receive material from us or some of our
            partners, and request that we delete or provide you with a copy of your personal data by logging into the Site,
            selecting ‘Settings’ from the dropdown in the top right, and scrolling down to find the appropriate option.
            If you would like further information in relation to your rights or would like to exercise any of them, you may
            also contact us via <a href="{% url "contact-us" %}">Contact Us page</a>.</p>
        <p> We try to answer every request promptly where possible, and provide our response within the time period stated
            by
            applicable law. Keep in mind, however, that when deleting your Personal Data there may be residual information
            that will remain within our databases, access logs, and other records, which may or may not contain your
            Personal
            Data. Please also note that certain Personal Data may be exempt from such requests in certain circumstances,
            which
            may include if we need to retain your Personal Data to comply with a legal obligation. When you email us with a
            request, we may ask that you provide us with information necessary to confirm your identity.</p>
